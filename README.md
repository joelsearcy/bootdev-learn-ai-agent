# AI Coding Agent

This repository contains a **toy AI Coding Agent** project, created as part of a learning exercise from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/). The goal of this project is to explore and understand how AI coding agents can assist with software development tasks.

> **Warning:**  
> This project is for educational purposes only. **Do not use this AI Coding Agent on real or production codebases.** It is not intended for practical use and may not follow best practices or ensure code safety.

## Project Structure

- `calculator/`  
    A simple sample project used to demonstrate the capabilities of the AI Coding Agent. This directory contains basic calculator functionality for testing and experimentation.
- `functions/`  
    Contains utility functions and their schema definitions to support the AI Coding Agent's operations and demonstrations.
- `call_function.py`  
    Defines the functions that are available for the AI Coding Agent to call and the logic for calling them.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Explore the `functions` directory and the AI agent code.
3. Review how the available functions are configured in `call_function.py`.
4. Review the system prompt in `prompt.py`.
5. Experiment and learn how AI coding agents can interact with code.
